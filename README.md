[Sherpa Finder - Live Link](https://hakesh.github.io/p1-sherpa-finder/index.html) (Right click to open in a new tab)

Sherpa Finder is a fictional website targeting both new and existing players in the video game Destiny who want to get help getting into and learning Raid content in the game. The website gives information about what we do, why we do it, how we help and a sign up form to let the players interested in getting our help to contact us.

It's one single scrollable website that has been designed to be responsive and usable on a wide range of devices and resolutions.

## Features

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

  - Image with a submission form inside 

- Footer [IMAGE HERE]
  - Social media icons with link re-directing the user to our social media platforms


I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

- A fixed header for easier/better access to the navigation of the website.
- A 'Meet the Team' page with various pictures of the fictional Sherpas the website offers to help players.
- Making my own page where the 'Sign Up' form would take you once registering instead of using the Code Institute formdump.


### Accessibility

I've tried to make the website as accessible as possible where I could by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using alt and aria-labels to describe the websites images and icons for screen readers.


## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML and CSS was used when making this website.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

- Git - For version control.

- GitHub - To save and store the files.

- Google Fonts - To find and import fonts used for the website.

- Font Awesome - To find and import icons used for the websites footer.

- Microsoft Edge Developer Tools - To troubleshoot, test features see and solve responsiveness, also to try get an understand why or how things were working.

- [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) - To show the website on a wide range of devices.


## Deployment

Github Pages was used to deploy the website. The instructions to achieve this can be found below:

1. Log in or sign up to Github.
2. Find the repository for this project, [p1-sherpa-finder](https://github.com/Hakesh/p1-sherpa-finder).
3. Click on the "Settings" button in the menu bar.
4. Click on Pages in the left hand side navigation bar.
5. From the Source dropdown menu, select "Deploy from a branch".
6. From the Branch dropdown menus, select "main" and "/root" respectively.
7. Click Save. Your live Github Pages site is now deployed at the URL shown at the top of the page. **Keep in mind it might take a bit before the page is deployed and a URL is shown, you might have to refresh the page after a few minutes to get it to show.**

The live link can be found here - https://hakesh.github.io/p1-sherpa-finder/index.html

## Testing

This website was developed using Microsft Edge. The use of Microsoft Edge Dev Tools have been used since the very beginning to troubleshoot this website for any problems that arose and to make sure the website was responsive on many different resolutions and devices. 

The website has also been tested in Google Chrome and it works as expected.




### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C Validator.](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fhakesh.github.io%2Fp1-sherpa-finder%2Findex.html)

- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) Validator.](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fhakesh.github.io%2Fp1-sherpa-finder%2Findex.html&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)

### Lighthouse Testing

### Unfixed Bugs

- Unable to make it required to select at least 1 checkbox in the sign up form. From my research you are unable to do this without the use of JavaScript which I don't know much about yet.


## Credits

### Content

All of the text content was written by myself. This website might be fictional, but Destiny Sherpas are a real thing in the game and my texts were written based on my own experiences, inspiritations and beliefs of what makes a 'sherpa'.

- [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
  - My repository was created using the GitPod template given by Code Institute.

- [Wallpaper Abyss](https://wall.alphacoders.com/)
  - Great resource for all kinds of wallpapers. This is where i found the background image for the sign up form.

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  - I didn't use any specific code snippet from them but they are such an incredible resource for learning that I feel i need to include them here as their explenation and examples can help by an incredible amount when trying to understand something!


- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified)
  - Thanks to his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE) on learning flexbox in 15 minutes he saved me a lot of time and frustration from trying to make my "About" section of the website work and look the way I wanted it to, which also made it very easy to make it responsive on all devices.

- [Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/)
  - For providing excellent images in their presskits and allowing their content to be used for non-commercial creations

- The Love Running Project
  - Got a lot of the inspiration of my website from this project, specifically the header, hero-image and sign up form. A lot of the things I learned following along that project is used here as well.




###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
