# Sherpa Finder

[Sherpa Finder - Live Link](https://hakesh.github.io/p1-sherpa-finder/index.html) (Right click to open in a new tab)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of this section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#bully-book-club-website)

Add a Blurb about the site here, what does it do, why did you build it?

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#user-experience-ux)

### User Stories

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Colour Scheme

Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for these fonts:
- Rajdhani for all website headings.
- Antic for all website body text / paragraphs and the navigation bar.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.


## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

- Home Page
  - Featuring a logo for the website, as well as a navigation bar and hero image 

- About
  - sdsd

- How We Help
  - sdsds

- Sign Up
  - Image with a submission form inside 

- Footer
  - Social media icons with link re-directing the user to our social media platforms

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

- A fixed header for easier/better access to the navigation of the website.
- A 'Meet the Team' page with various pictures of the fictional Sherpas the website offers to help players.
- My own website where the 'Sign Up' form would take you once registering instead of using the Code Institute formdump.


### Accessibility

I've tried to make the website as accessible as possible where I could by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using alt and aria-labels to describe the websites images and icons for screen readers.


## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML and CSS was used when making this website.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

- Git - For version control.

- GitHub - To save and store the files.

- Google Fonts - To find and import fonts used for the website.

- Font Awesome - To find and import icons used for the websites footer.

- Microsoft Edge Developer Tools - To troubleshoot, test features see and solve responsiveness, also to try get an understand why or how things were working.

- [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) - To show the website on a wide range of devices.


## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

- [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
  - My repository was created using the template given by Code Institute.

- [Wallpaper Abyss](https://wall.alphacoders.com/)
  - Great resource for all kinds of wallpapers. This is where i found the background image for the sign up form.

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  - I didn't use any specific code snippet from them but they are such an incredible resource for learning that I feel i need to include them here as their explenation and examples can help by an incredible amount when trying to understand something!


- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified)
  - Thanks to his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE) on learning flexbox in 15 he saved me a lot of time and frustration from trying to make my "About" section of the website work and look the way I wanted it to, and also made it very easy to make it responsive on all devices.

- [Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/)

### Content

All of the content was written by myself. This website might be fictional, but Destiny Sherpas are a real thing in the game and my texts were written based on my own experiences, inspiritations and beliefs of what makes a 'sherpa'.


###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  

###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
