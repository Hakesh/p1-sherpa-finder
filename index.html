                    <h3>What is a Sherpa?</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        The word "sherpa" originates from people of Tibetan descent who were guiding and helping people on mountain-climbing expeditions. How
                        does this translate into Destiny? 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Destiny Sherpas are similar in nature that they help people accomplish the most difficult content you can do in the game, by teaching
                        and guiding them how to do it without any pressure. Most commonly Sherpas teach the multitude of raids Destiny has to offer, but some do
                        also teach other harder activities in the game.

                    <h3>Why You Need a Sherpa to Help Shape Your Destiny</h3>
                    <p>
                        Raids are the pinnacle of end-game content in Destiny. The most prestigeous, some of the most fun and the most rewarding content with some of 
                        the best weapons and armor you can only get ahold of in the raids!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They are epic activities with fun, sometimes crazy jumping puzzles and incredible boss-fights/encounters with punishing mechanics that will test your 
                        skills and it's an experience you won't find anywhere else in the game, or most other games infact. However, there is a problem for some 
                        people that stops them from taking part in these awesome experiences.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The problem is that raids require you to have 5 other people to play with, and there is no match-making feature that will find people automatically for you. 
                        Having 5 friends playing the same game is not always so easy or realistic, let alone getting them all to be online at the same time. Of course there is
                        tools to solve this problem like using LFG channels (Looking For Group) to find people to play with, but they don't exactly offer a good experience
                        for people who don't have any experience doing raids before.
                        <br>
                        Most people on LFG want and prefer to have experienced players along with them for a faster or smoother
                        experience as raids are not simple in nature, they require you to know how to solve the mechanics as well as being able to communicate and work with your teammates
                        and the failure of 1 member is usually reflected on the entire team. This leaves people to wanting or even expecting to play with others who know whats going 
                        on, and being unwelcoming to people who don't.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Finding a clan to play with is also another option which usually have a more friendly environement compared to playing with 
                        random people you find on LFG, but finding a clan that suits your needs can be a whole other task in and of itself
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So it can be quite the hostile environment for those who haven't done raids prior but want to learn, and this is where we come in.
